The :nth-child(n) starts out with a colon which again identifies it as a pseudo selector.
Now we use the nth child for pattern selections ... so maybe you want
select every even or odd element.

And so can use the keywords of odd or even.

You can use just a number without an 'n' and that will select one element.

If you use 'n' that will repeate the pattern.  So if you had 2n that would select
every second element.

You can also use this formula: (an + b). 

'an' is the repeatable value.  B is where to start it at.
So if you had (3n+4) this would match child elements 4, 7, 10, etc.
